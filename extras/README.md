Script requires the following file naming conventions:

Converge report (*.csv) = "converge_report.csv"
iModules Export (*.csv) = "imod_export.csv"
iModules Designations Report (*.csv) = "imod_desg.csv"

Windows users will need to install ruby and ruby interpreter. They can also create a shortcut for running the script within the folder. See included documentation (.docx/.PDF).

All outputted final reports will appear in the "reports directory"
